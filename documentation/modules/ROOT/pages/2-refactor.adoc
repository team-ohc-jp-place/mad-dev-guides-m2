== Goals of this lab

The goal of this lab is to understand the modernization issues related to the `customers` application that you found in the previous exercise and learn how you can resolve them by code modification. The Tackle Analysis report also provides the details in terms of the *file name*, *path*, and *solution recommendations* for each issue.

At the end, you will again analyze the customers application using Tackle Analysis to confirm that the issues were successfully fixed.

== 2.1. Explore the Migration issues

According to the analysis report, the migration issues are related to external configurations with *hard-coded static IP addresses*.

image::static-ip-issue.png[static-ip-issue]

Let's look into the issue at the code level. In your VS Code server window, open the the `customers-tomcat-legacy` project and find `PersistenceConfig.java` file in *src/main/java/io/konveyor/demo/ordermanagement/config* directory.

image::persistence-class.png[persistence-class]

The `dataSource()` method creates an `ApplicationConfiguration` instance to configure JDBC variables such as _driverClassName_, _url_, _user_, and _password_. As you can see, the ApplicationConfiguration has a hard coded IP address reference in `persistence.properties`.

image::applicationConfiguration-class.png[applicationConfiguration-class]

== 2.2. Fix the External Configuration issues

The legacy ApplicationConfiguration class is being used in this application. This is discouraged by the migration guidelines, and should be replaced by a more appropriate approach using Spring's `@PropertySource` annotation and `Environment` class.

=== 2.2.1. Add Spring PropertySource annotation

Add the following annotation on top of `PersistenceConfig` public class.

[.console-input]
[source,java,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
@PropertySource("classpath:persistence.properties")
----

=== 2.2.2. Update DataSource method

Then, inject an instance of the `Environment` class using the Spring `@Autowired` annotation to refer to the local application configuration. Add the following class variable to the _PersistenceConfig_ class.

[.console-input]
[source,java,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
    @Autowired
    private Environment env;
----

Replace the `dataSource()` method with the following code to get JDBC configurations through this the _Environment_ injection.

[.console-input]
[source,java,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
    @Bean
    public DataSource dataSource() {
        final DriverManagerDataSource dataSource = new DriverManagerDataSource();
        dataSource.setDriverClassName(env.getProperty("jdbc.driverClassName"));
        dataSource.setUrl(env.getProperty("jdbc.url"));
        dataSource.setUsername(env.getProperty("jdbc.user"));
        dataSource.setPassword(env.getProperty("jdbc.password"));

        return dataSource;
    }
----

The `PersistenceConfig` class should look like this.

image::datasource-modification.png[datasource-modification]

=== 2.2.3. Update additionalProperties method

You also need to remove the *ApplicationConfiguration* reference in the `additionalProperties()` method. Replace the existing _additionalProperties_ method with the following code.

[.console-input]
[source,java,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
    final Properties additionalProperties() {
        final Properties hibernateProperties = new Properties();
        hibernateProperties.setProperty("hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto", env.getProperty("hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto"));
        hibernateProperties.setProperty("hibernate.dialect", env.getProperty("hibernate.dialect"));
        hibernateProperties.setProperty("hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache", "false");

        return hibernateProperties;
    }
----

=== 2.2.4. Update Packages

Remove unnecessary package imports (e.g. _ApplicationConfiguration_) and add new package images for DI injection and PropertySource.

The easiest way to do this is to replace all of the imports at the top of the file with this set of imports:

[.console-input]
[source,java,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
import java.util.Properties;
import javax.sql.DataSource;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.PropertySource;
import org.springframework.core.env.Environment;
import org.springframework.dao.annotation.PersistenceExceptionTranslationPostProcessor;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.config.EnableJpaRepositories;
import org.springframework.data.web.config.EnableSpringDataWebSupport;
import org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource;
import org.springframework.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager;
import org.springframework.orm.jpa.LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean;
import org.springframework.orm.jpa.vendor.HibernateJpaVendorAdapter;
import org.springframework.transaction.PlatformTransactionManager;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.EnableTransactionManagement;
----

=== 2.2.5. Remove Corporate libraries

With these changes, you don't need to refer to the external corporate libraries anymore. You can easily remove or comment out the dependency in your Maven project.

Open the `pom.xml` and comment (or remove) the following `config-utils` dependency.

[.console-input]
[source,xml,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
		<!-- Corporate libraries -->
		<!-- <dependency>
			<groupId>io.konveyor.demo</groupId>
			<artifactId>config-utils</artifactId>
			<version>1.0.0</version>
		</dependency> -->
----

=== 2.2.6. Update application.properties

In the meantime, the Globex retails system's *SRE team* has already migrated the `Oracle database` running from the virtual machine on `Red Hat Virtualization` to `OpenShift Virtualization` based on KubeVirt.

[TIP]
====
The link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/2.0/html/installing_and_using_the_migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/about-mtv_mtv[Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV)^] enables you to migrate virtual machines from VMware vSphere or Red Hat Virtualization to OpenShift Virtualization based on link:https://kubevirt.io[KubeVirt^]. This is an add-on to OpenShift Container Platform, enabling you to run and manage virtual machine workloads alongside container workloads.
====

Access the link:https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%/topology/ns/retail-%USERID%?view=graph[Topology view^] of reatail-%USERID% project in the Developer perspective. You will see the `oracle-database` virtual machine on OpenShift.

* Username: `%USERID%`
* Password: `{openshift-password}`

image::retail-topology.png[comment-dep]

In VSCode, Open the `application.properties` in *src/main/resources/persistence.properties* to access the *customers* data in the new *oracle-database* virtual machine on OpenShift.

Replace the following keys and values such as `jdbc.url`, `jdbc.user`, and `jdbc.password`.

[.console-input]
[source,properties,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
jdbc.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@oracle-database.retail-%USERID%.svc.cluster.local:1521/XEPDB1
jdbc.user=customer
jdbc.password=redhat
----

image::update-app-props.png[update-app-props]

=== 2.2.7. Test the build

Go to the `Terminal` window in VS Code server. Then, build and package the customer application again:

[.console-input]
[source,sh,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
cd $HOME/modern-app-dev/customers-tomcat-legacy/ &&
mvn clean package
----

The output should end up with `BUILD SUCCESS`.

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----

=== 2.2.8. Re-run Tackle Analysis

Go back to the link:https://tackle-tackle-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%/applications/analysis-tab[Tackle Analysis web console^] and create a new inventory element to analyze the modernized application (*customers*).

Click on `Create new`.

image::tackle-new-analysis.png[tackle-new-analysis]

Fill in the following fields, and click `Create`:

* Name: `New Customers`
* Description: `Modernized Customers management service`
* Business service: `Retail`
* Tags: `Java`, `Tomcat`, `Spring Boot`, `RHEL 8`, `Oracle`

image::tackle-new-app.png[tackle-new-app]

Once you go back to the Application inventory page, search `New Customers` by name. Then, choose the _New Customers_ application inventory. Click on `Analyze`.

image::tackle-search-new-customers.png[tackle-search-new-customers]

[NOTE]
====
Normally you would commit the code change, rebuild the application, and use that to analyse. To save time, you can find the already-modernized application (`customers-tomcat-solution.war`) that is packaged with the fixed code in your link:https://gitea.%SUBDOMAIN%/%USERID%/modern-app-dev[Gitea repository^]. You can use this instead of walking through multiple steps from _commit_ to _push_, and _pull_, and _build_ the new application artifact (_.war_ file) in your local file system.

image::gitea-repo.png[gitea-repo]

You can log in to the Gitea repository with the following credentials.

* Username - `%USERID%`
* Password - `openshift`
====

Once you download or clone the project to your local file system, explore if the `customers-tomcat-solution.war` file exists in the *packages-mta* folder.

Select `Upload local binary` in Analysis mode popup. Then, drag and drop the *customers-tomcat-solution.war* file or Upload it from your local file system.

image::add-new-applications.png[Add new applications]

Click on `Next`.

[NOTE]
====
Please make sure to see following success popup message on at the upper right. It probably will take a few seconds to complete the uploading of the binary file.

image::upload-success.png[upload-success]
====

You will now be presented with options for transformation targets. Click on `Containers`, `Linux`, and `OpenJDK` as parameters for the application analysis just as before.

image::configure-analysis-checked.png[Configure Analysis]

Click on `Next`.

Select `Application and internal dependencies only` for the scope of dependencies.

image::packages.png[Select packages]

Click on `Next`.

You will now be presented with options for custom rules.

image::custom-rules.png[Custom rules]

Click on `Add Rule` to upload a custom rule (`corporate-framework-config.windup.xml`) in the *customrules* directory that you have already downloaded in your file system.

Drag and drop the file or upload it from your local file system.

image::upload-custom-rule.png[upload-custom-rule]

Click on `Add`. Make sure if the custom rule is added. Click on `Next`.

image::enable-custom-rule.png[enable-custom-rule]

Next, click on `Next` in `Advanced options` to stick with the default options.

image::fine-tune.png[Fine tuning]

Lastly, we are presented with a summary of the configuration for our analysis.

image::finish-project.png[Finish project]

Click on `Run`.

Now the new analysis will start, and once it is finished you will be able to access the reports. Stay on this view until the analysis is finished.

Expand the customers application using the caret on the left. Then click on `Report`.

[NOTE]
====
The analysis will take a few minutes to pull the Windup image and execute the application analysis.
====

image::new-active-analysis.png[Active analysis]

Configure the project with the same settings and custom rules that we used for the Customers Service project. Once the report is finished, verify that it now reports `0` Story Points.

## Congratulations!

You have successfully migrated this app and now ready to deploy to OpenShift, *congratulations!*
